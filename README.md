Google Search page

This is the more difficult version of the HTML/CSS projects in the web development 101 course for the odin project. The aim is to recreate the Search page using HTML and CSS. There is no other coding in the page and link destinations are not required to complete the project.

During the project I gained a real understanding of pixels in measuring where the page elements were going in the CSS. I found that I was not searching for solutions as much as I did on the previous project, because I was able to recall the CSS and HTML from Memory. I am a lot more confident with both HTML and CSS, particulary with links, positioning, inserting images, using classes/IDs, using Typography and text alignment, using the appropriate colours and locating the right colours using browser tools.
